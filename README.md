# OmaFlow 1.3.0 is no longer maintained

This repository is the old fan2go plugin. Tags `v1.1.0`, `v1.2.0`, and `v1.3.0` stay here.

Omaflow 0.1 is the coolercontrold client. The window and the bar chip are one repository:

https://github.com/tempest-chaoscreator/omaflow

Do not run fan2go while `coolercontrold` is running.

# OmaFlow

Fan, pump, and AIO control from the [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org/) bar. Chassis fans through [fan2go](https://github.com/markusressel/fan2go), NVIDIA GPU fans through `nvidia-settings` (off until you enable them), AIO pump / radiator / LCD through [liquidctl](https://github.com/liquidctl/liquidctl). Same modes on both tabs, no separate panel for the pump.

## Compatible version

**Omarchy 4** (Quattro shell). Tested on Omarchy `4.0.4`.

## Dependencies

OmaFlow needs these to *apply* curves. Telemetry (CPU/GPU/coolant temps, RPM) works without them.

| Package | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [liquidctl](https://github.com/liquidctl/liquidctl) | AIO pump, radiator, LCD |
| [fan2go](https://github.com/markusressel/fan2go) | Chassis / motherboard PWM fans |
| `nvidia-settings` | GPU fans, only after you enable GPU on Settings |
| Python 3 | Already on Omarchy. Pillow is used to draw a tinted liquid-temp LCD |

Open the widget the first time and press **Install dependencies**. One password installs `liquidctl` and `omaflow-system` from the Omarchy repositories. `omaflow-system` is the helper, the polkit rule, and the fan2go unit. The plugin script does not run its own program as root.

Install **fan2go yourself** so `/usr/bin/fan2go` is the packaged binary. Setup does not download it. Chassis headers stay on the BIOS curve until that binary is installed and you run setup again so the unit can start.

`omarchy plugin add` never runs package managers or sudo. The setup script is the only step that asks for a password.

You can run the same script later:

```bash
~/.config/omarchy/plugins/tempest-chaoscreator.omaflow/setup
```

## Hardware

### Tested on

This machine:

| Role | Brand | Model |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CPU | AMD | Ryzen 9 5950X |
| GPU | NVIDIA | GeForce RTX 3090 Founders Edition |
| Motherboard | ASUS | ROG Crosshair VIII Dark Hero |
| AIO | NZXT | Kraken Z53 (LCD pump) |
| Fan hub | NZXT | Smart Device V2 |

AIO radiator fans on this build sit on an NZXT PWM hub into a motherboard header, not the Kraken fan header — so AIO fan control stays off unless you enable it.

### Supported (by backend)

<details>
<summary>NVIDIA</summary>

GPU fan control through `nvidia-settings` after you enable **GPU** on Settings. Zero-RPM idle (RTX 30-series Founders, and similar) is handed back to NVIDIA auto when the curve is 0%. Telemetry uses `nvidia-smi`.

- GeForce RTX 20 / 30 / 40 series
- GeForce GTX 16 series and newer with working `nvidia-settings` fan control
</details>

<details>
<summary>AMD</summary>

CPU package / CCD temps through `k10temp` (Ryzen). Chassis fans through any hwmon PWM device fan2go can see. No AMD GPU fan control in this release (telemetry only if the driver exports hwmon).

- Ryzen 3000 / 5000 / 7000 desktop (k10temp Tctl / Tccd)
- Board fan headers on ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte, ASRock when they appear as hwmon PWM
</details>

<details>
<summary>Intel</summary>

CPU temps through `coretemp` when present. Chassis fans through fan2go hwmon, same as AMD boards.

- Core i5 / i7 / i9 desktop with `coretemp`
</details>

<details>
<summary>NZXT</summary>

- Kraken Z53 / Z63 / Z73 — pump curve, LCD (liquid / accent / off), optional radiator fans
- Kraken X42 / X52 / X62 / X72 and X53 / X63 / X73 — pump (and fan where the device has one)
- Kraken 2023 / 2024 Standard and Elite — liquidctl LCD + pump
- Smart Device V1 / V2 — chassis fans via the kernel hwmon driver (`nzxtsmart2`)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Corsair</summary>

AIO pump / fan profiles through liquidctl when the device is listed by `liquidctl status`.

- Hydro H100i / H115i / H150i Pro / Elite / XT / Platinum class coolers
- Commander Pro / Core fan hubs if liquidctl exposes them
</details>

<details>
<summary>Other AIOs and hubs</summary>

Anything `liquidctl list` and `fan2go detect` can see. Pump duty is clamped to a 50% floor in every mode.

- MSI MEG / MPG CoreLiquid
- EVGA / NZXT Asetek 690LC units
- Aquacomputer D5 Next and similar liquidctl devices
- Generic motherboard PWM fans (Nuvoton NCT, ITE IT87, ASUS EC, …)
</details>

## Install

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/tempest-chaoscreator/OmaFlow.git --enable
```

Open the chip, then **Install dependencies** if liquidctl / fan2go are not on the machine yet.

The widget lands on the right of the bar. Move it with:

```bash
omarchy bar move tempest-chaoscreator.omaflow --section right
```

### Remove

```bash
omarchy plugin remove tempest-chaoscreator.omaflow
```

That deletes the plugin folder and its bar entry. liquidctl and fan2go stay installed; drop liquidctl with `omarchy pkg drop liquidctl`, and remove fan2go with the same package manager you used to install it. The helper is the `omaflow-system` package: `/usr/lib/omaflow/omaflow-helper`. The unit is `/etc/systemd/system/fan2go.service`, the config is `/etc/fan2go/fan2go.yaml`, and the database is `/var/lib/omaflow/fan2go.db`. Remove the package with `omarchy pkg drop omaflow-system`.

## Using it

| Action | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Left click the chip | Open / close the panel |
| Right click | Toggle Silent ↔ Performance |
| Middle click | Switch Telemetry / Settings |
| `1`–`5` | Silent, Static, Performance, Hell, Custom |
| `m` / `s` | Telemetry / Settings (`c` still opens Settings) |
| Escape | Close |

**Telemetry** — CPU (Tctl + CCDs), GPU (temp, load, power, fan), coolant, pump, chassis RPM, one-minute sparkline. The mode buttons on this page are the ones that change the live curve.

**Settings** — five modes and an NZXT CAM-style graph. CPU-temperature graphs run 28–98 °C. Liquid-temperature graphs (Pump, AIO, and CPU) run 28–60 °C, which is as hot as coolant should get. GPU stays on 20–90 °C. Drag a handle up and the points to its right come with it. Silent / Static / Performance / Hell share one padlock. Custom is always unlocked. Reset restores only the selected channel. Edits on this tab do not change the live mode; pick that on Telemetry.

Pump, AIO, and CPU each have a curve input: CPU temp or liquid temp. GPU and AIO (and CPU, when a CPU fan header is detected) hide their on/off switch until you select that card. The card grows to show a horizontal switch. CPU stays grey when fan2go sees no CPU fan. The info mark next to Reset explains one-cable AIOs: leave the CPU switch off and let the BIOS run `CPU_FAN`, or split the cable so the pump is on `AIO_PUMP` and the radiator fans are on `CPU_FAN`.

The bottom of Settings exports and imports a JSON file of the stored curves and settings.

Every channel card has a switch. Off does not stop the fan. A motherboard header (chassis, `CPU_FAN`, `AIO_PUMP`) is handed back to the BIOS curve. NVIDIA fans go back to the driver's own curve. A USB cooler has no BIOS curve, so OmaFlow simply stops sending new speeds and the device keeps the last duty — never 0%. Silent's AIO curve sits 10–15 points above the chassis curve. The AIO card opens on CPU temperature. If fan2go sees an `AIO_PUMP` header and there is no USB cooler, that header follows the Pump curve. A USB pump and that header are never driven together.

GPU and AIO stay off until you enable them. Chassis and Pump start on. The CPU switch is shown on its card and stays locked off when no `CPU_FAN` header is detected.

| Mode | Fans | Pump |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Silent** | Low floor, slow ramp | 50% floor, then up with CPU temp |
| **Static** | Flat 50% | Flat 60% |
| **Performance** | Steep ramp | 75% floor, then up |
| **Hell** | High floor, stays aggressive | 75% until warm, then 100% |
| **Custom** | Yours | Yours (still 50% minimum) |

Pump duty never goes below 50% in any mode, including Custom — dragging a pump handle below that floor snaps it back.

AIO LCD:

- **Liquid temp** — coolant readout. With **Sync with theme accent** on, OmaFlow redraws it in the theme color (stock firmware liquid is white).
- **Theme accent** — solid fill of the Omarchy accent.
- **Off** — black screen, brightness 0.

## How it applies

- **fan2go** owns motherboard / NZXT Smart Device chassis fans. The bridge keeps a copy of the curve at `~/.config/omaflow/fan2go.yaml`. The root service does not read that file. It reads `/etc/fan2go/fan2go.yaml`, which the helper republishes after checking the document. The database is `/var/lib/omaflow/fan2go.db`.
- **nvidia-settings** owns GPU fans only after you enable GPU on Settings. A 0% target returns the card to NVIDIA auto so 3090 zero-RPM idle works.
- A detected **CPU fan** header is driven by fan2go only after you enable CPU. Off, that header is left to the BIOS.
- **liquidctl** owns the AIO: pump curve, radiator curve, LCD, optional LEDs. Those profiles live on the device.
- If fan2go is not running yet, the bridge holds chassis PWM itself so the modes still do something after setup.

Telemetry is always available from hwmon and `nvidia-smi`, even before the stack is installed.

## Privileged paths

Setup pins `scripts/omaflow_helper.py` to a SHA-256 in the setup script. It reads that file once, checks the digest, and passes the bytes to a root installer on stdin. The installer does not open the plugin directory. An active local member of `wheel` can run the installed helper without a password. Its commands are fixed: write a PWM value, release a header back to the BIOS, publish a checked curve document, import an existing root-owned fan database once, restart the unit, and check that `/usr/bin/fan2go` is a root-owned binary.

The helper refuses `cmd` and `file` fans, refuses any database path other than `/var/lib/omaflow/fan2go.db`, and binds the API to `127.0.0.1:9001`. The unit sets `ProtectHome` and `PrivateTmp`, so the root daemon cannot read the home directory or `/tmp`.
